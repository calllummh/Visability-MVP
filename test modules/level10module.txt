Module Structure:
1. Introduction (5 minutes)

Engaging video: “Why do guests get upset?”
Highlights real-life conflict scenarios in hotels/restaurants.
Quick poll: “What’s the hardest part of handling guest complaints?”
2. Core Learning (20 minutes)

Real-world case studies:
A guest insists their room was promised a sea view, but the booking says otherwise.
Two customers argue over a reserved table.
Learners analyse differing perspectives and identify bias (emotional vs factual claims).
3. Practical Application (25 minutes)

Live role-playing:
Learners are paired in breakout rooms as “Guest” and “Manager.”
Guests present conflicting stories, and managers must listen critically and resolve the issue.
Peers rate resolution effectiveness and provide feedback.
Listening Bias Challenge:
Learners listen to two versions of a complaint (angry vs calm tone).
Identify how tone affects perceived credibility.
4. Personalisation (10 minutes)

Self-reflection exercise:
Think of a past guest complaint and analyse:
What biases were present?
How could you have listened better?
AI coaching feedback: Learners submit voice recordings of their responses, and AI provides automated feedback on emotional neutrality.
5. Assessment & Feedback (10 minutes)

Recorded guest interaction test:
Learners listen to a difficult guest conversation and submit a written resolution strategy.
AI and peer assessment provide feedback.
Manager review (optional): Learners can request a hospitality mentor to review their response.
